                        Project Teams is a quarterly program that provides
                        students with design experience in a collaborative
                        setting. Each quarter, students form teams and work on a
                        design project of their choice (e.g. UI/UX design,
                        marketing design, graphic design) from start to finish.
                        Participants learn essential design skills along the
                        way, become familiar with industry-standard tools, and
                        have a completed project for their portfolio at the end
                        of it! No prior experience is necessary, but Project
                        Teams will be on a first-come, first-served basis due to
                        limited capacity.
