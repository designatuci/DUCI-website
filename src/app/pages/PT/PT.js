				<Text className='color gray'>
					Project Teams is a quarterly program that provides students with design
					experience in a collaborative setting. Each quarter, students form teams
					and work on a design project of their choice (e.g. UI/UX design,
					marketing design, graphic design) from start to finish. Participants
					learn essential design skills along the way, become familiar with
					industry-standard tools, and have a completed project for their portfolio
					at the end of it! No prior experience is necessary, but Project Teams
					will be on a first-come, first-served basis due to limited capacity.
				</Text>
				<Text className='color gray'>
					For Fall 2023, Project Teams will meet Thursdays at 4&ndash;6 PM from
					weeks 2 through 9.
