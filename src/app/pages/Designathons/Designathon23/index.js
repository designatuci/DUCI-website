					Design-a-thon is a 3 day long hybrid event where you or a

					Design at UCI is the premier student-run organization at UCI
					for anything graphic design, UI/UX design, product design,
					and more. Started in 2016, we foster a special community for
					all digital designers to connect, learn, and innovate.

					Design at UCIâ€™s designathon is the largest collegiate
					designathon in Orange County. Each year, we bring together
					hundreds of student designers nationwide to define, develop,
					and pitch a product built from scratch. We hope that this
					experience can help you acquire and grow both your soft and
					hard skills in empathizing with your users, defining a set
					of goals and needs, developing your product, and improving
					your confidence and creativity as a human-centric designer.
