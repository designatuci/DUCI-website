		q: 'Why should I join?',
		a: 'Creating an aesthetically pleasing, functional product is not only what a designer does; it is to listen to what our world needs, empathize people’s gain and pain points, and produce a solution that specifically targets what our world is lacking. We hope that this event can be a platform where you can practice your design thinking—a process of ideation, research, analysis, developing, and testing—to provide a better means to our world.',
