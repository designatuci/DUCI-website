		"about": "Hi, I'm Wenting. I have 8 years of experience in Design Research & Strategy with a background in both Service Design and Structural Engineering. I have led various projects and helped clients improve their Digital/Physical Products, Intangible Experiences/Services, and Operation Management in different industries: Retail, Museum, Jewelry, Restaurant, Healthcare, etc. I am a Data Teller and a Systems Thinker, who believes in research-driven design strategy. Solid research is the foundation to unveil and narrate system institutes, leading to win-win solutions. As an emphatic team worker, I embrace diversity and value co-creation as a trait that translates research findings into meaningful design insights. Before switching to Research & Strategy, I have 2 years of experience in Product/UX Management from 2015 to 2017 and 2 years of experience in BIM (Building Information Modeling) Project Management from 2013 to 2015."
