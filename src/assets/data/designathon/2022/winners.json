The app features alternative recipes to familiar meals so that individuals can overcome their fear of trying a new diet without any pressure or guilt.  Most importantly, users can see the carbon emissions of each dish to increase awareness of the carbon footprint of certain foods. Being able to visualize the changes they’re making allows them to believe they can make a difference with small steps. In the words of Remy, the famous rat chef from the Disney movie 'Ratatouille', anyone can cook (sustainably)."
